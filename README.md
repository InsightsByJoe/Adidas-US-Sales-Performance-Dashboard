## **Tools Used**
- **Microsoft Excel**: For data loading, cleaning, and analysis.
  - **Pivot Tables**: Used for summarizing and analyzing data.
  - **Charts & Slicers**: For interactive data visualization.
  - **Power Query**: For data transformation and cleaning.

You can download Microsoft Excel from the official Microsoft website [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel).

## **Process**
1. **Data Loading & Inspection**:
   - The data was pre-processed, so minimal cleaning was required.
   - Inspected the dataset for duplicates, missing values, and incorrect data types.

2. **Data Analysis**:
   - **Pivot Tables** were created to break down the sales data by products, regions, retailers, and sales methods.
   - Various **charts** (line charts, bar charts, pie charts) were used to visualize sales performance, trends, and comparisons.
   - **Slicers** were implemented for interactivity, allowing users to filter data dynamically.

3. **Dashboard Creation**:
   - Designed an easy-to-understand layout with KPIs at the top to highlight key metrics such as Total Sales, Operating Profit, Units Sold, and Average Price per Unit.
   - Used different chart types to represent monthly sales trends, product-wise sales, regional breakdowns, and retailer performance.

## **Findings**
- The **West** region had the highest sales, both in terms of units sold and total revenue.
- **Menâ€™s Street Footwear** emerged as the top-performing product category.
- **West Gear** and **Foot Locker** were the leading retailers in terms of sales.
- **California** and **Florida** were the top states contributing to Adidasâ€™ overall sales.
- The **online sales** channel showed substantial growth, though in-store sales remained dominant.

## **Recommendations**
- Prioritize expanding the product offerings in high-performing regions, particularly the **West**.
- Enhance the **online sales** platform to capitalize on the growing shift towards e-commerce.
- Devise marketing strategies to boost sales in lower-performing regions like the **Midwest**.
- Strengthen partnerships with top retailers, focusing on **West Gear** and **Foot Locker** to increase overall market share.

## **Limitations**
- The analysis was based on processed data, and certain granular insights (such as customer behavior or promotional impact) were not included.
- Seasonal effects or external market conditions (e.g., economic trends) were not considered in the analysis.

## **Conclusion**
This project provided a deep dive into Adidas US sales performance, leveraging Excelâ€™s powerful data analysis tools. The dashboard presents a clear, actionable overview, showcasing the top regions, products, and sales methods. It demonstrates my skills in using **Pivot Tables**, **Charts**, and **Slicers** to develop professional dashboards and generate meaningful business insights.
